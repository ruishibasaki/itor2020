/** The class MPSolver provides a standard interface between "Generalized
    Bundle" algorithms for NonDifferentiable Optimization and the (complex)
    algorithms that solve their Master Problems.

    The user is assumed to be familiar with generalized Bundle algorithms:

    As a quick description, the data of the Master Problem is a set B of 
    vectors z[ i ] that are alfa_{Lambda}[ i ]-subgradients of some (convex)
    function Fi in some current point Lambda. This set of vectors (bundle)
    is used to construct a "model" Fi_{B,Lambda} of the "translated function"

      Fi_{Lambda}( d ) = Fi( Lambda + d ) - Fi( Lambda )

    such that Fi_{Lambda}( 0 ) = 0. The "classical" model is the (translated)
    Cutting Plane model of Fi in the current point Lambda

    \hat{Fi}_{B,Lambda}( d ) = max{ z[ i ] * d - alfa_{Lambda}[ i ], i \in B }

    that is a polyhedral lower approximation of the "true" (translated)
    function Fi_{Lambda}( d ). alfa_{Lambda}[ i ] (>= 0) is called the
    linearization error of the subgradient z[ i ] in the point Lambda, and
    it depends linearly on Lambda.

    Fi_{B,Lambda} is used to find a tentative descent direction for Fi at
    Lambda by solving the (Stabilized) Primal Master Problem

      P_{B,Lambda,t}:   inf{ Fi_{B,Lambda}( d ) + D_t( d ) }

    where D_t() is a family of "stabilizing functions", enjoing some
    properties [see the reference], which is indiced over the "proximal
    parameter" t, a positive real number. P_{B,Lambda,t} has a (Fenchel)
    dual, the (Stabilized) Dual Master Problem

      D_{B,Lambda,t}:   inf{ Fi_{B,Lambda}*( z ) + D_t*( -z ) }

    where "*" indicates the Fenchel's conjugate operator.

    A number of different Master Problems may be constructed by properly
    choosing the actual model Fi_{B,Lambda} and the "stabilizing term" D_t:
    this base class is designed to define a common interface for all them.

    The above presentation is only schematic: the interface of MPSolver offers
    support for advanced features like constraints on the primal space,
    "disaggregated bundles" for decomposable functions, on-line variables
    generation and active-set variable reduction strategies, sparse
    subgradients and others. For instance, if box constraints

      LB <= Lambda <= UB

    are imposed on (some of the) variables Lambda [see GetUC() and GetUB() in
    FiOracle.h], then the Stabilized Primal Master Problem becomes

      P_{B,Lambda,t}:   inf{ Fi_{B,Lambda}( d ) + D_t( d ) ,
                             LB - Lambda <= d <= UB - Lambda }

    since it must guarantee that LB <= Lambda + d <= UB, being its variable d
    a displacement from Lambda. For further details, see the references and
    the interface below, as well as the interface of Bundle, NDOSolver and
    FiOracle [in Bundle.h, NDOSolver.h, and FiOracle.h, respectively]. */

/**< Provides the MPSolver with basic information about the "size" of the
   Master problem:

    \param MxBSz is the maximum number of different items (subgradients and
           constraints) that can be managed by the class, i.e. the maximum
	   size of the bundle: the protected field MaxBSize is offered by
	   the base class to store this information;

    \param Oracle is a pointer to the FiOracle object [see FiOracle.h] that
           calculates the function Fi to be minimized: the other numbers
	   describing the size of the problem can be obtained by calls to
	   methods of the FiOracle class, and three protected fields are
	   offered by the base class to store some of this information

           - MaxSGLen the maximum length of any item, i.e., the maximum
	     number of variables in the Primal Master Problem (PMP);

           - CrrSGLen (<= MaxSGLen) is the current length of any item: the
             interface supports on-line creation and destruction of primal
	     variables;

           - NrFi the function Fi to be minimized may be "decomposable",
             i.e., the sum of k functions; in this case, its model
	     Fi_{B,Lambda} is usually decomposable as well (for instance,
	     the Cutting Plane model is), For decomposable functions, it is
	     possible (altough not necessary) to keep k "separate bundles",
	     each one describing a model Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda} of each component
	     Fi[ k ] of Fi, which may be beneficial to improve the "exactness"
	     of the model. Special support is offered for the case when one of
	     the components is a linear function, by considering it as the
	     "0-th component" of Fi [see ReadFiBLambda() and [Set/Get]Item()
	     below].

    \param UsAvSt is true if the Active Set technique will be exploited by
           the solver, and false otherwise. In the first case, the initial
	   "active set" of variables is *empty*, and a nonempty set of
	   active variables must be set with SetActvSt() [see below]. In
	   the second case, SetActvSt() *must not* be called, and all the
	   variables are considered to be always "active".

   This information may be necessary for allocating the data structures of
   the class, so this method *must* be called prior to any other method. Other
   information from the FiOracle is likely to be useful for the MPSolver, such
   as the max expected density of the subgradients [see FiOracle::GetMaxNZ()],
   which variables are constrained in sign or has upper bounds [see
   FiOracle::Get[UC/UB]()], and which of the components of Fi(), if any, is
   "easy" [see FiOracle::GetBNC() ...].

   \note "easy" components of Fi() have basically to be dealt with by the
         MPSolver, by inserting their description in the Master Problem;
	 if this is not possible, the Master Problem has to signal it (e.g.
	 by throwing an expection) because the Bundle algorithm relies on
	 this and the FiOracle is not going to provide "ordinary" black-box
	 information (function values, subgradients, ...) for these
	 components.

   \note *Important*: "easy" components of Fi() in the Master Problem are
         *not* translated *by value* (but they are by argument), meaning that
	 the function that is included in the MP is

	   Fi_{Lambda}[ k ]( d ) = Fi[ k ]( Lambda + d )

	 and *not*

	   Fi_{Lambda}[ k ]( d ) = Fi[ k ]( Lambda + d ) - Fi[ k ]( Lambda )

	 as one would expect by analogy with the ordinary "difficult"
	 components. This is done to spare the Bundle algorithm with the
	 need to compute Fi[ k ]( Lambda ) for all "easy" components k and
	 each current point Lambda, which may be problematic especially for
	 the *initial* current point---consider the case where Lambda *is
	 not feasible*, so Fi[ k ]( Lambda ) = +INF! However, the value of
	 Fi[ k ] is actually computed by the MPSolver at Lambda + d* (d*
	 being the optimal solution of the Primal MP), so the value of
	 Fi[ k ] is known for the current point at least after every Serious
	 Step with step 1 along d*. Yet, this choice has some impact on the
	 "output" methods [see ReadFiBLambda() and ReadSigma() below].

   This method can be called more than once to modify the settings, but expect
   the implementation to be quite expensive in time and/or memory. There are
   essentially three different ways for calling SetDim():

   - SetDim( 0 , ... ) makes the MPSolver to deallocate all its memory and to
     quietly wait for new instructions.

   - SetDim( n , 0 , ASV ) with n != 0 sets the max bundle size to n and
     activate/deactivate the Active Set Mechanism without changing anything
     else. The existing items in the bundle (if any) are all kept if n is
     larger than the previous setting, but a smaller value will force deletion
     of all the items with "name" [see [Get/Set]Item() and RmvItem() below]
     greater than or equal to n. Also, if the active set technique is
     initialized (ASV == true while it was false previously), the set of
     "active" variables is set to be *empty*.

   - SetDim( n , Orcl , ASV ) with n != 0 and Orcl != 0 discards all the
     previous settings and re-allocates everything; all the existing items in
     the bundle are lost. Note that such a call also resets every parameter
     of the algorithm, such as the starting point (which is set to 0).

   In general, calling this method with a non-empty bundle could be costly, so
   if the items are to be discarded anyway, this should be done *before* the
   call to SetDim() [see RmvItems() below]. */

   When Fi is a decomposable function [see SetDim() above], each of its
   components may have a separate model Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}, thus this method
   has different meanings according to the value of wFi. For 1 <= wFi <= NrFi,
   the lower bound is on the *individual* model Fi[ wFi ]_{B,Lambda}, while
   for wFi > NrFi the lower bound is on the *global* model
   Fi_{B,Lambda} = sum_{k = 0 ... NrFi} Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}. Note that the
   0-th component is taken into account for the global model, while, being
   a linear function, it clearly cannot have any "individual" lower bound.

   These lower bounds are automatically updated when the current point Lambda
   is changed [see ChangeCurrPoint() below], and they are equivalent to
   inserting in the bundle of the proper component an all-0 subgradient with
   alfa_{Lambda}[ i ] = - LwBnd (which is nonnegative). The same holds for
   the "global" lower bound, except that it is an "aggregated" all-zero
   subgradient.

   \note Individual lower bounds are meaningless for "easy" components of
         Fi() [see FiOracle::GetBNC() ...], and therefore they are not

   Passing - HpINF as the lower bound means that no such bound is available;

/**< Attempts to solve the current Master Problem.

   \note The bundle for some components of Fi may be empty; if this happens,
         those components must just be temporarly ignored (like they did not
         exist) in the solution of the MP. If all the "sub-bundles" for each
         of the components are empty, what is solved is just a "pure
         feasibility" MP which returns just any point in the polyhedron
         defined by the constraints, if any. If there are neither subgradient
         nor constraints, then the optimal (both primal and dual) solution
         must be all-0.

   \note The last sentence is not valid if there there are "easy" components
         of Fi() [see FiOracle::GetBNC() ...], since in this case the primal
	 solution d* of the MP is typically non-0 even if there is no
	 subgradient for any of the "difficult" components; what happens is
	 that the bundle is not empty since "those of the easy components
	 always contain all the possible subgradients".

   The method must return:

   kOK       if the solver found an optimal solution;

   kUnbndd   if the MP is primal unbounded: this can only happen with some
             "not-really-stabilizing" terms D_t, and should always be
	     solvable by properly increasing the proximal parameter t;

   kUnfsbl   if the MP is primal unfeasible (dual unbounded or empty, see
             ReadMult() below);

   kError    in case of a failure in the MP solver.

   If the "active set technique" is being used [see SetActvSt() below], the
   problem that is solved is actually a *restriction* of the "real" MP, where
   (possibly many) primal variables d[ i ] are forced to 0; this "restricted"
   MP may be *empty* (so that the solver might have to return kUnfsbl) while
   the full MP is nonempty. Hence, after a kUnfsbl return a "price in" [see
   Readd() below] should be done to find if new variables can to be added to
   the "restricted" MP in order to try to make it nonempty. Thus, in the
   unfeasible case ReadMult() [see below] must return the multipliers that
   make a *feasible ascent extreme ray* in the dual, so that the corresponding
   direction returned by Readd() [see below] is nonzero on variable `i'
   (strictly positive if `i' is constrained) if and only if that variable
   has to be added. */

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/*---------------------- METHODS FOR READING RESULTS -----------------------*/
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

   virtual HpNum ReadFiBLambda( cIndex wFi = Inf<Index>() ) = 0;

/**< Returns the value of the model Fi_{B,Lambda} in d*, the optimal primal
   solution of the MP; this value is often called "v*". This is the value of
   the *translated* model

      v* = Fi_{B,Lambda}( d* ) = Fi_B( Lambda + d* ) - Fi( Lambda ) ,

   hence it is a negative value that indicates the improvement in the
   Fi-value that the model Fi_B() predicts for a step to Lambda + d*.

   When Fi is a decomposable function [see SetDim() above], each of its
   components has a separate model Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}; ReadFiBx() must
   return:

   - Fi[ wFi ]_{B,Lambda}( d* ), if 0 <= wFi <= NrFi;

   - \sum_{k = 1}^{NrFi} Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}( d* ) if Inf<Index>() > wFi >
     NrFi, i.e., the value of all the models *excluding* the linear one;

   - the value of the aggregated model if wFi == Inf<Index>().

   Note that if there are no subgradients (of a given component) in B, the
   problem that is solved is different from the standard one, as there is
   no such thing as a model for that component. Thus the model is temporarily
   removed from the master problem (like adding a constraint v[ wFi ] >= 0
   for the usual representation where v[ wFi ] is the value of the model).
   In this case, ReadFiBLambda( wFi ) must return Inf<HpNum>().

   The above changes if Fi has "easy" components [see FiOracle::GetBNC() ...],
   because the model of each "easy" component is *not* translated by value.
   Hence, if wFi is the index of an easy component then the method returns

     Fi[ wFi ]( Lambda + d* )

   rather than

     Fi[ wFi ]( Lambda + d* ) - Fi[ wFi ]( Lambda ) .

   Note that in both cases this is the *actual value* of the (corresponding
   component of the) function, because for easy components *the model is the
   actual function* (that is, Fi[ wFi ] == Fi_B[ wFi ]). This information is
   easily extracted out of the solution of the (Dual) Master Problem: if
   x[ wFi ]* is the optimal solution of the Master Problem in terms of the
   "original variables" of the wFi-th component, the required value is just
   ( c[ wFi ] - (Lambda + d* ) * A[ wFi ] ) x[ wFi ]*).

   Note that the 0-th component is an "easy" one but it is dealt with as a
   "difficult" one, in that the translated model (the only possible one,
   the true linear function) is used. */

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

   virtual HpNum ReadDt( cHpNum tt = 1 ) = 0;

/**< Returns the value of the primal stabilizing term D() in the primal
   optimal solution d* if tt is taken as the proximal parameter. */

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

   virtual HpNum ReadSigma( cIndex wFi = Inf<Index>() ) = 0;

/**< Returns the value of the conjugate Fi_{B,Lambda}* of the model
   Fi_{B,Lambda} in z*, the optimal dual solution of the MP; this value is
   often called "sigma*".

   When Fi is a decomposable function [see SetDim() above], each component
   (of the model) has a separate conjugate function Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}* and
   a separate dual solution z[ k ]*: the dual stabilizing term is then

     D_t*( - \sum_{k = 0}^{NrFi} z[ k ] ).

   If primal constraints Lambda \in L are added to the primal, this is viewed
   as adding the indicator function I_L of the feasible set to the stabilized
   Primal Master Problem; this corresponds to having the support function
   \sigma_L appearing in the dual objective function. Thus, in this case the
   dual objective function is

     \sum_{k = 1}^{NrFi} Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}*( z[ k ] ) + \sigma_L( w ) +
                         D_t*( - \sum_{k = 0}^{NrFi} z[ k ] )

   i.e., it has a term for each component, the stabilizing term and an
   extra term for constraints (this term is always zero in the primal
   because the indicator function I_L is zero in L).

   Thus, ReadSigma() must return:

   - Fi[ wFi ]_{B,Lambda}*( z[ i ]* ) if 1 <= wFi <= NrFi: note that the
     value for the 0-th component of Fi is always 0, since the conjugate of
     a linear function is 0 iif its argument is equal to the gradient and
     +Infinity otherwise---in other words, z[ 0 ] is always equal to the
     gradient of the 0-th component;

   - \sum_{k = 1}^{NrFi} Fi[ k ]_{B,Lambda}*( z[ k ] ) + \sigma_L( w ) if
     wFi > NrFi, i.e., the dual objective function except the (dual)
     stabilizing term.

  \note For "easy" components of Fi() [see FiOracle::GetBNC() ...] the value
        that should be returned by this method is the *actual* value of the
	conjugate of the (corresponding component of) Fi(). Although it may
	be possible to extract that information out of the solution of the
	MP, a Bundle algorithm typically will never use it, so the MPSolver
	is allowed to assume that ReadSigma( wFi ) will never be called with
	wFi the index of an "easy" component. Furthermore, as in the case of
	ReadFiBLambda() [see above], in an "aggregated" call (that is, with
	wFi > NrFi) *only the difficult components are counted*, that is, the
	value of the conjugate of the model of an "easy" component *never*
	has to be computed. */

      z* = Sum{ i \in B } Theta[ i ] * z[ i ]

   where z[ i ] is the item with "name" `i' [see [Set/Get]Item() below].

	 x[ wFi ]*, and it is therefore a FiOracle::GetBNC( wFi )-vector. This

   costly and can be deactivated, see CheckIdentical() above), which is not
   an unlikely possibility e.g. when Fi is the Lagrangian function of a
   combinatorial optimization problem (and therefore the set of possible

   The return value must be the "name" of a constraint in the bundle that is

   that *the component to which the constraint belongs is now irrelevant*,
   and therefore that the checks *have to be performed across all the
   components* (comprised the 0-th). The reason is that while a constrant
   nominally belongs to one component (in Lagrangian terms, the corresponding
   primal unbounded ray is for one particular subproblem) this has no impact
   on the master problem: unlike subgradients, two identical constraints
   (columns) corresponding to two different components actually are the same
   constraint (column) in the master problem, and therefore one is redundant.
   Thus one can (and therefore should) safely declare a constraint a copy of
   another even if they belong to different components. Note that this
   corresponds, from the primal side, to choose between two different primal
   rays belonging to different subproblems, and therefore it does have an
   impact on the generated primal (convexified) solution. However, if one
   would keep the two constraints then it would be the Master Problem solver
   which would arbitrarily "split the corresponding primal variables among
   them", so a decision would still be somewhat taken in this respect that is
   entirely out of control; better, then, to at least save some running time
   and memory. If this turns out to be a problem for some weird reason, the
   check can be deactivated with CheckIdentical() and the problem solved.

   As for CheckSubG(), the scalar product between the primal optimal solution
   d* of the MP and SG must be calculated and returned in ScPri.

   Ai must contain the Right Hand Side, i.e., the constraint on the original

   in the MP must be

   of CrrPnt depends on whether or not the "active set" strategy has been

   CrrPnt[] is in "sparse" format, i.e., `CrrPnt[ i ]' is the value for the
   variable with name `AVrs[ i ]' for i = 0 ..  AVDm - 1, all the other
   values being zero. Otherwise, CrrPnt[] is in "dense" format. Upon return,
   Ai must be updated to the "scaled" Right Hand Side w.r.t. the current
   point, that is

     Ai = Ai - SG * CurrPnt.

   The Ai computed by CheckCnst() are typically used in the MP. Note that

/**< Solving the MP can be costly; a possible way of decreasing the cost is to
   resort to an "active set" strategy over the primal variables d[ i ]. That
   is, one may guess that a (large) set of the variables will have 0 as the
   optimal value, and only let the others (the "active set") to vary; if it
   turns out that the guess has been incorrect, the active set must be
   revised by inserting or deleting variables [see [Add/Rmv]ActvSt() below].
   This way, a smaller MP is solved at each step.

   Whether or not an "active set" is used is decided in SetDim() [see above];
   if it is, then SetActvSt() sets it to the variables whose names are in the
   first AVDm entries of the vector AVrs[] (which must be ordered in
   increasing sense and Inf<Index>()-terminated, i.e. AVrs[ AVDm ] ==
   Inf<Index>()). It is an error to call SetActvSt() if the active set option
   has not previously been selected with SetDim().

   Note that changing the active set has *no impact* on the linearization
   errors of the items. Setting the active set dictates which among the
   primal variables d[ i ] of the MP can be different from zero, hence,
   which primal variables Lambda[ i ] of the original NDO problem may change
   their value w.r.t. the value that they have in the current point. The
   linearization errors of the items depend on the current point only,
   and therefore they change if and only if the current point changes [see
   ChangeCurrPoint() and [Add/Rmv]Vars() below]. Since setting the active
   set affects only the variables d[ i ] of the MP and does not affect the
   value of the primal variables Lambda[ i ] of the Bundle algorithm, setting
   (or changing) the active set has no impact on the linearization errors.

   Note that **the pointer passed to SetActvSt() will be retained and used**
   until it is changed, either by a new call to SetActvSt() - which just
   substitutes any previous active set with the new one - or by calls to
   [Add/Rmv]ActvSt() [see below]. Thus, the caller should not change it while
   it is "in use" by the MPSolver object; the vector can only be changed
   *after* the return of the call to SetActvSt() or [Add/Rmv]ActvSt() which
   makes it unused. This implies that any call to SetActvSt() which sets an
   entirely new active set must pass a pointer that is different from the one
   which contained the old active set [see also [Add/Rmv]ActvSt() below].
   Exception is of course AVrs == 0, that sets an *empty* active set: that
   is, the active set option is used (only SetDim() can change this), and it
   currently contains no variables. This is the default if SetActvSt() has
   not been called yet.

   Important note: after a call to SetActvSt(), all the solution information
   corresponding to the last call to SolveMP() is *lost*, and the results
   returned by all the query methods are unpredictable. This is true even for
   CheckSubG(), CheckCnst() and ChangesMPSol(), so adding items to the bundle
   after a call to this method is not advised. */

   AVrs must point to a vector containing the *new* active set; a pointer to
   that vector is kept and used from now on as the new active set, replacing
   the old vector set with the latest call to one of SetActvSt(), AddActvSt()
   or RmvActvSt(). Thus, the vector pointed by the "old" pointer can be
   freely modified after the return of AddActvSt(), while the one pointed by
   AVrs must not be modified until it is in turn substituted by a new one.

   Thus, AVrs must usually be different from the "old" pointer; one exception
   is permitted, however, in the case when all the variables to be added are

/**< This method adds `NNwVrs' new variables to the MP, in response to a call

   classes are required to use GetUC(), GetUB(), GetGi() and (possibly)
   GetADesc() [see FiOracle.h] to acquire directly from the FiOracle all the
   information about the newly created variables they need.

   The method is used when NDOSolver::AddVariables() is called, i.e., when
   new variables Lambda[ i ] of the original NDO problem are created. Note
   that adding variables Lambda[ i ] changes, in principle, the current point,
   and therefore the linearization errors of the items. For instance, in the 
   Lagrangian case, it is easy to check that the linearization error
   alfa_{Lambda}[ i ] of the subgradient named `i' with respect to the
   current point Lambda is simply

    alfa_{Lambda}[ i ] = Fi( Lambda )
                       - c( x[ i ] ) + Lambda * ( b - A( x[ i ] ) )

   where x[ i ] is the solution of the Lagrangian problem corresponding to
   the subgradient. Thus, adding a new variable Lambda_j changes the
   linearization error of Lambda_j * ( b_j - A_j( x[ i ] ) ). Hence, the
   linearization errors of all items change *except if Lambda_j == 0*. In
   order to avoid the recomputation of the linearization errors, it is
   assumed that all the variables d[ i ] of the Primal Master Problem added
   with AddVars() correspond to variables Lambda[ i ] that are *set to 0*;
   in other words, it is assumed that adding the variables does not change
   the linearization errors (changing them is always possible with
   ChangeCurrPoint()).

   Note that, if an "active set" has been defined [see SetDim() above], then
   the newly added variables are *not* added to the current active set; this
   *must* be done explicitly, if needed, with [Set/Add]ActvSt() [see above].
   If the active set option has not been selected, then the variables are
   automatically added to the MP.

   Important note: after a call to AddVars(), all the solution information
   corresponding to the last call to SolveMP() is *lost*, and the results

   CheckSubG(), CheckCnst() and ChangesMPSol(), so adding items to the bundle

   NDOSolver::RemoveVariables(). As for NDOSolver::RemoveVariables(),
   whch == 0 means "remove all variables" (hwmny is ignored in this case).

   As opposed to RmvActvSt() [see above], the effect of this removal is
   permanent; the variables are eliminated from the whole MP, rather than
   just "temporarily set aside" outside of the active set. Indeed, this
   "permanent" removal can only happen *after* the removal from the active
   set: no variable in the active set can be removed, i.e., RmvVars( 0 )
   can only be called if the active set is *empty* (if, of course, the

   As for AddVars() [see above], it is assumed that the removal of the

   that all the variables d[ i ] of the Primal Master Problem that are
   removed correspond to variables Lambda[ i ] of the NDO problem that
   have value zero in the current point; it is responsibility of the
   caller to ensure this, using ChangeCurrPoint() if required.

   i.e., DLambda is the direction that is followed (with step 1) to go from
   the old current point Lambda to the new current point newLambda. DLambda
   is in "dense" format [see MakeLambda1() above], i.e., `DLambda[ i ]'
   contains the displacement relative to variable `i' for
   i = 0 .. CrrSGLen - 1. Note that the set of variables with nonzero
   displacement may *not* be a subset of the "active set" [see
   [Set/Add/Rmv]ActvSt() above], i.e., that the entry of the current point
   for variable `i' may vary even if i is currently forced to be zero by
   being out of the active set, In order for the Master problem to become
   "aware" of the change for these variables, the active set has to be
   changed.

   DFi[ k ] must be the change in the value of the function between the two
   points, i.e.,

    DFi[ k ] = Fi[ k ]( newLambda ) - Fi[ k ]( Lambda )

   for 1 <= k <= NrFi, while

    DFi[ 0 ] = Fi( newLambda ) - Fi( Lambda )

   (i.e., the value of the whole function). Note that the values for "easy"
   components are provided as well, altough the MPSolver in principle knows
   them already.

   The formulae for updating the data are the following. If z[ i ] is a
   alfa[ i ]-subgradient to the k-th component of Fi in Lambda, then it is
   a newalfa[ i ]-subgradient (to the k-th component of Fi) in newLambda,
   where

     newalfa[ i ] = alfa[ i ] + DFi[ k ] - DLambda * z[ i ] .

   If z[ i ] is a constraint

     z[ i ] * ( Lambda + d ) <= RHSi

   its right-hand side in the d-variables is RHSi - z[ i ] * Lambda. Hence,
   for newLambda = Lambda + DLambda the constraint has to become

    z[ i ] * ( newLambda + d ) <= RHSi ,

   that is, its right-hand side in the d-variables is

    RHSi - z[ i ] * newLambda =
           ( RHSi - z[ i ] * Lambda ) - z[ i ] * Dlambda .

  In particular, for box constraints on the Lambda variables [see GetUC()
  and GetUB() in FiOracle.h], the Master Problem has to contain box
  constraints on the d variables (assuming for simplicity every variable
  is box constrained)

    LB - Lambda <= d <= UB - Lambda .
 
  Clearly, when the current point is changed to newLambda = Lambda + DLambda
  these constraints have to become

    LB - newLambda <= d <= UB - newLambda ,

  that is, ( LB - Lambda ) - Dlambda <= d <= ( UB - Lambda ) - Dlambda.  */
